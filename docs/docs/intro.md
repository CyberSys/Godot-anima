## Installation

The plugin is available on the [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/852).

### Manual Download

The latest version can be manually downloaded by cloning [this repo](https://github.com/ceceppa/anima) and copying the contents of `addons/anima` into the same folder in your project.

## Example

```gdscript
Anima.begin(self) \
  .then(
    Anima.Node($node) \
      .anima_animation("tada", 0.7)
  ).play()
```

**NOTE** in Godot 4.0 you'll be able to wrap everything in parenthesis to avoid repeating "[variable].":

```gdscript
# Works on Godot 4.0 only:

var anima = (
  Anima.begin(self)
  .then(Anima.Node($node).anima_animation("tada", 0.7))
).play()
```
